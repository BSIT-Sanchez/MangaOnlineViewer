<h1>Manga OnlineViewer</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>This scripts loads all pages(images) from the current chapter of the manga showing them in one page in a list type structure, witch helps reading faster.
Please note the this script may he a heavy on resources on a few sites, so please open only one tab of each site at a time and wait it finish loading.
I'll try to keep this script updated, however I hardly-ever visit some of the sites supported, if you find it no longer works, post it in the feedback area, and have patience.
I allow this script to be posted or used anywhere so long it gives me credit and provides a link back to this site. I allow parts of my script to be used freely.
